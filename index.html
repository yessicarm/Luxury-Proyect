                    website,
                    paid advertising, social media, and other means.

                        <p>To reach your potential buyers, you have to know who they are, where they spend their time
                            online,
                            and how they make their buying decisions. Agents who use luxury real estate marketing
                            services are
                            able to identify your niche market, then create paid ads on Facebook, Google, Instagram, and
                            YouTube
                            that reach those interested in your property. These paid ad campaigns are highly customized
                            and
                            targeted, ensuring you are not spending money marketing to those who are not in the market
                            for a
                            property such as yours.

                        <h2>Expert Content Production </h2>
                        <p>Content is one of the most powerful resources a real estate agent has to promote your
                            property. Being
                            able to create high-quality content such as video and copywriting is an essential tool that
                            elevates
                            the agents who use luxury real estate marketing services above their competitors. According
                            to a
                            recent survey, 85 percent of buyers and sellers want to work with an agent who uses
                            video—and for
                            good reason. An agent who uses video is able to connect with potential buyers on a deeper
                            level and
                            build trust and rapport. When they use video to market your property, they are showing
                            viewers what
                            it would really be like to walk through and live in your home—something that is much more
                            difficult
                            to do with a written description.
                            However, written descriptions—or copywriting—is also important. Your property needs to be
                            described
                            in appealing and vibrant terms on the listing and on any additional marketing that is
                            created to
                            sell it. Those agents who work with Luxury Presence get access to experienced real estate
                            copywriters who create blogs, website copy, and content marketing pieces that make your
                            property
                            attractive to potential buyers.

                        <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
                        <p>If your real estate agent is an influencer on social media, he or she has access to thousands
                            of niche buyers who are ready to invest in property. To be an influencer, an agent either
                            needs to dedicate a large chunk of their time to social media or they need to partner with
                            luxury real estate marketing service providers who can put in the work for them. Wouldn’t
                            you rather your agent spent his or her time marketing your property and let an expert handle
                            their social media presence? At Luxury Presence, our dedicated success team utilizes an
                            agent’s stories and feed posts to help them go viral and become an authority in their
                            industry. Once they’ve harnessed the power of becoming an influencer, they can use their
                            voice to advocate for your home and sell it more quickly than their competitors.
